# etch-a-sketch

My second project with GUI, reused HTML and some of CSS from the rock paper scissors project to faciliate the deployment.

Stuff that can certainly be fixed:
- eventlisteners where pseudoclasses were sufficient;
- overall layout;
- add few more buttons (random color, grid slider to the grid size this way, instead of entering a number).

May revisit at some for some quick implementation, but I guess it's lower priorirty than the RPS - the scope for significant improvement is rather slim.
